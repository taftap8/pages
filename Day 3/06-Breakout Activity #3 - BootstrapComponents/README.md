# Bootstrap Components Research & Creation
Navigate to <http://getbootstrap.com/components/>

## Option 1: Create your own page using different bootstrap components you've researched

* Create a new HTML file, try to include at least 10 different Bootstrap components in this file, and be ready to discuss after the activity.

* You can add a Bootstrap component inside of your document by copying and pasting any of the examples on the Bootstrap Components page.

## Option 2: Try to clone an existing page using bootstrap components

* For the remainder of class, you will be using Bootstrap to create a clone of one of the following websites:

  * <https://github.com/>
  * <http://stackoverflow.com/>
  * <https://twitter.com/>
  * <https://www.amazon.com/>
  * <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/>

* Use the inspector to find color values for elements on the real website, along with any other values you may need.

* Use the Bootstrap grid to space the various components on your web page to roughly where they fall on the real site. Don't worry too much about being exact here!

* If you have another website you would like to try instead, run it by your instructor for approval.

* Note: You'll still need to include your own CSS file to add more specific custom styling to your web page. Make sure this is included in your `index.html` file **after** Bootstrap is included.
